Technical specification for the game: 


Text-based adventure games is a classic genre where all the interaction takes place though on screen-words, and they still alive today. In our group project we have started to develop text-based RPG with several features. This game include the main character with name that you have given, health power (HP), maximum health power (maxHP), attack (Atk), experience (exp) to level up and, eventually, monetary currency is gold. 

When a player open the game, he/she can see the Play menu. There are several options: explore the world or check your character's stats.

You can imagine that you are in another fictional world and explore it. And, of course, there will be difficulties along the way. For instance, enemies. The enemy, like any other game you know, can also deal damage and has health power. Moreover, your opponent can damage you in fight mode, that is why we have added restore health power. Drawing a conclusion from this, each meeting with the enemy helps the main character to increase the experience. The more experience you get, the higher the level of the character will be.

In addition, something that any character in the game cannot do without â€“ inventory. Here you can store the things (in the amount of three) that the character received during the exploring the world.
